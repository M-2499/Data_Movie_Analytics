# Movie Prediction Analysis Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Movie Prediction Analysis Project! This project focuses on predicting the success of upcoming movies using data-driven insights and machine learning. By identifying and analyzing key factors, we aim to build a robust model capable of forecasting a movie's performance.

## Objectives

- **Establish Criteria for Success:**
  - Utilize a diverse dataset to define criteria that signify a movie's success.

- **Visualize Correlations:**
  - Use data visualization, leveraging Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, to uncover correlations between a movie's success and various factors.

- **Build Machine Learning Model:**
  - Develop a predictive model using Python, employing libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas. We utilized the following dependencies:
    - `pandas` for data manipulation.
    - `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` for building the machine learning model.
    - `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` for scaling numerical features.
    - `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split` for splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
    - `sklearn.metrics` for evaluating the model's performance, including confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report.
    - `%matplotlib inline` for inline plotting in Jupyter Notebook.

- **Identify Key Success Factors:**
  - Analyze the model to identify the most influential factors in a movie's success.

## Analysis and Visualization

- **Python for Data Manipulation and Analysis:**
  - We utilized Python, along with popular data science libraries such as Pandas and NumPy, for data manipulation, analysis, and model building. These Jupyter Notebooks contain our Python-based analysis.:
  -  movie_prediction_model.ipynb
  -  movie_prediction_model_(ultimate_film_stats).ipynb  

- **Tableau for Visualizations:**
  - Tableau was employed for creating interactive and insightful visualizations based on the analyzed data. You can explore our Tableau visualizations [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/joel.johnson6608/viz/Group1FinalProject_17011356172600/Movies?publish=yes).

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
2. Navigate to the `movie_prediction_model.ipynb` file
3. Run each cell to perform the analysis and build the machine learning model.
